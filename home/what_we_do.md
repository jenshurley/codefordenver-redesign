# Background Information

### What does Code for Denver typically do?

We work with nonprofits or local government to building apps or websites that serve their needs. Who we work with and what issues we address are determined during first Monday pitch nights.  To stay on top of the things throughout the year, we host weekly meetups to manage things and work on current projects.


### To what degree is your work influenced by Code for America?
Our projects are member-driven. We seek inspiration from other brigades and adopt many of the working practices and values of Code for America. Code for America connects us to the wider civic technology movement. Through them, we are able to learn from other brigades and leaders in civic tech.

We partnered with organizations on these projects:

* Colorado Anti Violence Program
Responsive tool that streamlines internal reporting and external intake forms

# Skills at Code for Denver

###I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, nonprofits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down!

###I'm a beginner programmer. Can I still get involved?

Yes! Many of our members have been beginning programmers who have found the environment helpful to improve their abilities while providing something of value.


###What languages / frameworks do you typically use?

We don't use one particular language or framework all of the time. What we use depends on the nature of the project and the groups that we serve.

Members have expressed a long term interest in Clojure, React.js, and Rails.

If your stack is different, contributing is still possible!   


# How we use Agile
Code For Denver utilizes many Agile practices and tools in our distributed development environment to help us deliver the most value, at the earliest possible time to our partners.  

### Roles
We sign up for the agile roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner for each project, and our Sprints last two weeks and end in demos.

### Meeting management
We complete a stand-up each week, and share what was done last week, what will be done in the coming week and surface any blockers. We also use the Pomodoro time management technique to focus our work during project nights.

### Tools
We utilize Github as our code repository with a kanban board inside the application "Waffle" that sits on top of the repo.  Within the waffleboard, we plan our project tasks using the familiar "backlog", "ready", "in progress" and "done" states fir each task.  

Our current workflow includes:

* General/team communication and chat: [Flowdoc](http://www.flowdoc.com)
* Version Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/)/[Github](https://github.com/codefordenver)
* Story management: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)
* Documentation/Technical writing: [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B15HLk4_JV3nWjkyOGtFUmhKZDQ&usp=sharing_eid)

Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with any of these tools. Well help you get up and running.
