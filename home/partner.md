# Can We Help You?

### Become a Partner
## What kind of projects does Code for Denver work on?
Code for Denver provides technology, design, organizational and coding expertise. Our primary goal is to provide support to those who usually do not enjoy the kinds of services we provide. This could be due to size or budget. Our ideal project involves:
A small to medium-sized nonprofit or public institution
A product that is open-source and reusable on other projects
Use of flexible, open-source technology
A need for at least one of our areas of expertise
We focus our energies on small to medium-sized nonprofits and public institutions. For a more detailed, but not comprehensive, list of project types we seek and avoid, click *here* (link this text).
## What is Code for Denver's project proposal process?
There are several steps to getting a project accepted for work with Code for Denver.
A potential partner completes an application.
A Code for Denver leader screens the application to make sure it fits the basic guidelines from above.
On the first Monday of each month the group considers each project according to two criteria:
Is the project appropriate for work by Code for Denver?
Is there a brigade member interested in following up/being the initial champion?
If the answer to both questions is yes, the project moves into the defined idea stage. If either answer is no a member follows up with the proposer to inform them we will not move forward with it.
The need for a champion is the most critical aspect of this process. Without a champion the project is leaderless within Code for Denver. Attending the meeting and connecting with members is key to us accepting your proposal.
Look at some of our *previously completed projects*(link this text) to get a sense of the work we do.
## What is the project development process?
Accepted Code for Denver projects have four classifications:
Vague ideas
Defined ideas
Validation
Active Development

#### Ugh! There are too many languages and resources to choose from! Where is the best place to start?

We suggest Codecademy or CodeSchool. Both start with the basics, have plenty of free courses, and can be completed entirely in your browser.

As far as languages are concerned, HTML/CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python great languages to start with. All are in widespread use, cross-platform (used on/in multiple devices and environments), and are supported by plenty of documentation.
