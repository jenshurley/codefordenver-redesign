## Background Information

**WE ARE SO EXCITED YOU ARE HERE!**

You are on your way to some serious
civic hacking.


#### So how do I get involved?

Start by joining our Meetup.com group at www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver. This is where we list all of our upcoming meetings and events. We meet weekly to work on projects. RSVP or just drop by and say hello.

#### How many people are working on a project at any given time?

This varies according the circumstances and there are no hard and fast rules that set a minimum or maximum number of volunteers per project. For the sake of efficiency, we aim to focus our efforts by limiting the number of projects in active development.

#### Is there any one person who is typically in charge of projects?

Each project has a scrum master, product owner, and tech lead. Organizers listed at our [Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver/) work to make sure that the roles are filled. [[Section in can_we_help_you has more information about this]]

## Contributing

A good place to start is by reading our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefordenver/codeofconduct),
if you haven't already.

When you are done with
that come back here and let's talk about some of the tools
we use to communicate, collaborate and self-organize.

## Getting Started with the tools

- ### Meetup.com
	is our event organizing tool.

	**[You can sign up for upcoming civic-hack nights and other important events](http://www.meetup.com/codefordenver/).**


- ### Flowdock.com

	Flowdock hosts our [chat room](https://www.flowdock.com/app/cfa-brigades/code-for-denver). We use it to
	engage with other members, share progress, ask questions.
	It's cross platform so you can use it anywhere, you'll love it.

 	**Get you account by emailing codefordenver@gmail.com or by
 attending one of our meetups.**

- ### Google Drive

    Google drive hosts our group's [shared documents](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B15HLk4_JV3nWjkyOGtFUmhKZDQ&usp=sharing_eid). You will need to request access to the folder.

- ### Github.com
	is our source control solution and hosts our [code repositories](https://github.com/codefordenver). This is how we
	share code between members and other brigades around the world.

	**[Get an account here](https://github.com/).**


- ### Waffle.io
	is our light-weight project management solution.
	A simple Kanban not unlike Trello with very nice github integration.
